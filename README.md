## Introduction

The Real Estate Price Prediction Project is an application of data science and machine learning techniques to predict property prices based on a set of relevant features. Accurate price prediction is essential for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a predictive model to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert data source] and contains information about various properties, including attributes such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate and reliable model training.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files and data preprocessing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- `models/`: Saved model files after training.
- `app/`: Web application files for deploying the model.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, create a virtual environment and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project`

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase involves cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Refer to the `data_preprocessing.py` script for detailed implementation.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. Various techniques, such as creating new features, selecting relevant features, and transforming variables, are explored in the `feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook.

## Modeling

The `modeling.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the process of selecting, training, and evaluating machine learning models for price prediction. Different algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation metrics are discussed.

## Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The final model's performance is compared against baseline models in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed using a web application located in the `app/` directory. The app provides an interface for users to input property features and receive predicted prices based on the deployed model.
